# Knn Classification of Irises

This project uses the Knn algorithm to classify species of Iris by petal measurements with 97% accuracy. This was acheived by finding trends in the data through visualization and then using those trends to pick predictor variables. With predictor variables picked, 5-fold cross validation was used to pick a k-value to build the model. For more details, read through the project as it has explanations of each step alongside analysis of the results.
